Projects

Hindi AI Text Summarizer | Abstractive NLP System [Link - https://github.com/yashrajkastode/Hindi-Text-Summarization]

A production-oriented system for generating abstractive summaries of Hindi text using Transformer models.

◦ Designed and implemented an abstractive Hindi text summarization pipeline using the google/mt5-base
Transformer model for sequence-to-sequence generation.

◦ Built a scalable Django REST backend with clean service-layer separation for preprocessing, model loading,
and inference logic.

◦ Integrated Celery with Redis to offload computationally expensive NLP inference tasks, ensuring non-blocking
API performance.

◦ Implemented a custom Hindi text normalization pipeline to handle noisy news data, whitespace artifacts, and
linguistic inconsistencies prior to model inference.

◦ Optimized inference with controlled decoding strategies (beam search, repetition penalties) to improve grammatical
correctness and summary coherence without model fine-tuning.

◦ Tools Used: Python, Django, Django REST Framework, PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, mT5, Celery,
Redis, Git

Med-Matrix | Full-Stack Drug Interaction Checker [Link - https://github.com/yashrajkastode/med-matrix]

A pharmaceutical safety tool that identifies harmful drug-to-drug interactions based on chemical salts.

◦ Migrated backend architecture from Flask to Django 6.0, implementing a robust RESTful API and secure
CORS configurations.

◦ Developed a many-to-many comparison algorithm to detect hazardous interactions by analyzing constituent
chemical salts across a database of 100+ medications.

◦ Built a modern, responsive UI using Tailwind CSS featuring an interactive accordion system for component
breakdown and real-time autocomplete search.

◦ Optimized for production with Gunicorn and a Procfile, maintaining clean version control via Git/GitHub.

◦ Tools Used: Python, Django, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, Gunicorn, Git

Hasthakshar using Deep Learning [Link - https://github.com/yashrajkastode/Hastakshar]

Computer vision system to recognize and translate Indian Sign Language gestures

◦ Creating a custom dataset of Indian Sign Language gestures for training the detection model.

◦ Implementing stick figure representation for skeletal keypoint detection and analysis.

◦ Utilizing deep learning frameworks (TensorFlow/PyTorch) for real-time gesture recognition achieving 90%
accuracy.

◦ Tools Used: Python, TensorFlow/PyTorch, OpenCV, MediaPipe, NumPy, Matplotlib
